Nobody really knows who started this tradition, but it is the custom
to embark on a new project by printing "hello world".  It is an old tradition,
maybe even reaching back to the dark times after the collapse of the EVE Gate.

{% highlight scala %}
object Main {
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, world!")
  }

}
{% endhighlight %}
