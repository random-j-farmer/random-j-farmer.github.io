I am in Okkamon, spoiling for a fight when a firetail jumps in my plex.  I've seen him on D-Scan and I have
already loaded EMP.  Also my drones are out and set to aggressive.

We start the dance.  It's an arty firetail and he tries to stay away from me.  I do manage to stay in
range for most of the fight, but at the end I notice my scram and web are turned off.

My shield booster runs out of charges.  My repper runs out of paste.  I barely bring him into structure.

Again a pretty good fight.  I am improving and I think the Breacher is a good ship for this.
It's tanky, the fights tend to last a bit longer, you get to practice more before your ship explodes.

A couple of points:

* I had trouble keeping in range - but I see that the guy likes to fly dual web.
* Still I need to watch my ranges more
* And my cap.  I am not sure why my web turned off at one point, but it did.  Maybe I ran out of cap?
* I don't think firetails are shield tanked. Should have loaded Scourge
