A fed nayv comet is waiting at the plex.  I have Nova loaded.  This one does not try to pull away.
I manage to stay 3km to 4km off.  For some reason my auto attack drones do not actually attack
until I tell them so.

Things go pretty well until I run out of cap.  I know I run out of cap because a voice is telling me so,
repeatedly.  Is that new?  Anyway, I like it.  This time I know that cap is the issue

I panic and switch of my repper and booster, these are the buttons I press the most.
I don't have much of a buffer, so the fight is [over](https://zkillboard.com/kill/52521576/) pretty soon after that.

I should have switched off the scram.  He has me over the barrel, he is not warping off.
For bonus points, I would have noticed the cap issue above 25% where recharge rate plummets.

I will have a look at my cap skills.  And I will have to investigate some other damage control:
the one I had fitted is suddenly worth 8M ISK, more than the rest of the fit.
