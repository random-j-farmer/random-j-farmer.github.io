Or the sad tale of how Bananatron#1 met his ignominious fate.

![sad bananatron, no yellow](/img/the-death-of-bananatron-1.jpg)

I had repped up some NPC damage and loaded fresh paste into the repper.  I got bored and played around with the scanner.
Ooooh, an executioner at a novice!  Quick, before it gets away!  And I yoloed into the plex at half shields.

The executioner does some  pretty nice kiting, my armor is half gone before I get into scram range.  No problem,
I'll just start the repper.  Oh noes!  The button, it does nothing!

And then, the final insult!  There is nothing yellow on the killmail! Bananatron is ... disfigured

But hey, I got a fight! 10/10 would yolo again
