I did not pay attention to the null sec shenigans until a couple of weeks ago.  Sanders
Schmittlaub from A Band Apart started to organise an optional deployment to
the OSS staging system.  I went there, but those fleets were too shiny for me,
so mostly I was scanning for wormhole connections.

Not very eventful, although my null sec adventure started with a bang ...
in Jita.  I forgot about my security status ...

I don't mind a bit of scanning, but this looked like it might become one of EVE's big wars,
and I wanted to have some kills to remember it by.  So I joined Pandemic Horde again.

And yesterday evening I found myself in the biggest fleet I've ever been in (240 people?  I think we were 240
at the start - although that might have been mumble).  We laid siege to the SMA station in O1Y-ED, 
preventing SMA from undocking in anything but Interceptors.  This gave our second fleet the opportunity 
to entosis everything in sight.

I did not get on a lot of kills, my killwhoring drones were killed by a bomb run
almost immediately after I launched them.  This left me trying to lock targets
with my Ferox before they were killed by faster locking ships.  I only managed
to get on one killmail, but hey!  [I was there!](https://zkillboard.com/kill/53017685/)
