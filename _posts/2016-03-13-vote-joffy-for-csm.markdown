Last chance to vote for [Joffy Aulx-Gao](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=6091284#post60912)!

There is even a super-handy [ballot link](https://community.eveonline.com/community/csm/vote#Joffy%20Aulx-Gao%2CThe%20Judge%2CErika%20Mizune%2CTora%20Bushido%2CSteve%20Ronuken%2CDiana%20Olympos%2CDoToo%20Foo%2CToxic%20Yaken%2CNashh%20Kadavr%2CBorat%20Guereen%2CMr%20Hyde113%2CApothne%2CGorski%20Car%2CKyle%20Aparthos).  

Yes, I am late to the party, but he asked, and I do have a blog, even if nobody reads it.
So vote Joffy, and in the year to come I get to point at this post and tell people
I told them he'll be awesome.
