I wanted a simple ship to get over my shakes, so I cooked up a batch of merlins.
Yesterday they were ready so I fit a blaster merlin and went on a little roam.

I could not find a solo fight so I made my way back to Hykanima. I idled some
in a novice plex when a Firetail appeared on D-scan.

I was pretty fast with locking him and put my 2 webs on him.  He did manage to pull
a bit off and put a scram on me.  And then ... I just could not close into void range.
By this time I had the shakes real bad and I did not think to overheat my AB.
He was MWD fit of course.  By the time I had crept into range I was down to 
25% shields or so.  I did manage to get him to half shields, 
then I [popped](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56185929/).

I guess I should have fit scram and web after all.  Looking at his last Firetail loss, he
had about 50% more EHP - but I had 50% more DPS.  Another time, maybe.

This fight was not quite as bad as the last one, but I really need to get over those shakes.
