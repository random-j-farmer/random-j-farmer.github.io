Banatron has risen from the ashes and his yellowness blinded his foe! Maybe it reflected
the laserbeams?

Anyway, Bananatron emerged victorious from glorious single combat with a T1 Executioner piloted by
a hardened 2 month veteran pilot!  With a little help from a caldari frigatte.

I almost feel bad about this one.  T1 fit, 2 month old pilot.  I sent him some ISK.  I was pleasantly
surprised he went at me alone - militia pilots usually don't in my experience.

This time around I tried a rail fit.  Also manual piloting all around - I managed the ranges OK-ish for
the most part.  Keeping traversal down will need more practice.

I am not sure I would have won this against a T2 fit executioner with a more experienced pilot.
Still, nice to resume PVP with a win after my ratting extravaganza.  Much more fun.

And I did try to pod him.  He warped off though.  Good on him :)
