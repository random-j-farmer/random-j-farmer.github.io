Opened a small in Nennamaila, a Hawk warps in with me.  I slide in, he follows, and it is on.
First time I am flying the T2 version of my o-plexing fit, and as my shields and armor go down
I am almost cackling.  Hah hah, let's see how he likes my hull tank!

But he chews through my hull surprisingly fast and I pop.

Much to the Hawk pilot's amusement, I'd forgotten to fit the rigs - my hull tank was
still in my cargo.

Oops.
