I am leaving Perkone Factory when I notice Lady Patricia's shuttle just floating 20km off the undock.
Easy prey for a budding pirate like me.  Let's be honest here, I am kind of crap at the solo game.  Easy
prey is just what the doctor ordered.

I've been killed by gate guns, so I've learned to align before opening fire.  I don't manage to kill
the shuttle before I have to warp off. I should have taken more time to align my approach with
my escape vector.  But she does not notice a thing, I warp back to the crime scene and finish my
[dirty deed](https://zkillboard.com/kill/52214623/).  The gate guns don't care.

And then ... there is the pod, just sitting there.  I had planned to rat my sec status back up to 2.
I am not sure I want to go full pirate.  But ... it's just sitting there.  The easiest prey of all.
I switch the safety to red and open fire. [Ooooh, shiny!](https://zkillboard.com/kill/52214635/)

The gate guns notice, too.  Apparently, podding is considered a separate crime.  Who knew!
I almost make it into warp, but I was already deep into armour.  [Spaceship go boom!](https://zkillboard.com/kill/52214640/)

Well, I learned something new for the bargain price of 5M ISK or so after insurance.

Actually, I learned two things. I guess I am a bloodthirsty pirate, after all.
