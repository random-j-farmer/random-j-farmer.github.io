> -- This may help to get in a Horde frame of mind

Pandemic Horde does not have SRP (there are exceptions, but as a general rule: Just say No)

Some people seem to be baffled by this.  Mr Mittens, for one, is harping on and on about it.
As are the CFC members spamming O1Y-ED local.  It really seems to boggle their minds.

I've been in Pandemic Horde for the majority of my time in EVE. I have been in corporations
that had SRP (EVE-Uni and KarmaFleet).  I've never missed SRP in Horde.

I think not having SRP is a key factor in what Horde is all about:  no drama,
no bullshit, just pew pew pew.

* No filling out forms
* No drama because some special snowflake got their SRP denied
* No drama because some ships (are not\|should not be\|should be) SRP-ed
* No middle management SRP department
* Anybody can FC - if they can get people to join their fleet
* No filling out forms for the prospective FC
* No middle management FC supervision jobs
* Line members are encouraged to learn from mistakes.  Say a
  newbie FC takes a Ferox fleet out into 120 bombers. With SRP
  that's excellent ISK/hour, without SRP it's a learning opportunity.

My personal favorites?  All the "no middle management" bits.  Good riddance.  

I'd rather pay for my ships.
