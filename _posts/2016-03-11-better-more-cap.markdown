After yesterdays [adventure](/2016/03/10/comet-cap-confusion.html) I've taken a closer look at my fit,
and boy, have I been wrong.

Warp scrambler, web and afterburner use almost no cap - 0.3 GJ/s for scram and web, 0.675 GJ/s for the AB
(I use the enduring metas of all three).  With those 3 modules running, my Breacher is cap stable at 91%.

The only other module that is using cap is the AAR, and it's using a lot of cap: 8.33 GJ/s

So ... on this particular fit, the only thing that makes a difference from a cap perspective 
is the AAR.  Running low on cap?  Don't run the AAR.  Everything else is peanuts.

Still - even with the AAR running (along with everything else), cap should have lasted for 1 min 50 seconds.
I don't think the fight lasted 2 minutes. More like 30 seconds.  And I still had half of my paste.

He must have neuted me.

Next time: when running low on cap, switch of the AAR. Leave everything else on.

I am also thinking of switching to the scoped meta scrambler.  It would need more cap (0.75 GJ/s), but the
range would be better, maybe allowing me to stay out of neut range.
