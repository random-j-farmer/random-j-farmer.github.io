My favorite [kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/51780006/) was a couple of weeks ago.

I don't remember all the things I did wrong (main reason I started this blog, I
wanted a place to make notes about my screwups),  but I'd jumped in on couple
of stabbed farmers that night, and then I saw that heron in a novice plex.

I assumed it would be another farmer, so my main concern was closing in fast and
getting tackle.  I was very surprised when he immediately started shooting.
Anyway, dual web, armor tanked heron, I was right in his range and I had
the wrong ammo loaded (EM).

He killed me with a Heron, and it wasn't even close.  Well played Sir.
