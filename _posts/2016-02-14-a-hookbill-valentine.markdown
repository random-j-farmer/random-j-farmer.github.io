Roaming around Okkamon late sunday night after the kid finally fell asleep.

[A wild hookbill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/52030921/) appears on my d-scan.
I load EMP and overheat my guns and repper.  Angled approach.  
First surprise is he starts doing big damage before my guns even scratch
his paint. I am in half armor when my guns start hitting, but he
keeps me off at 10km.  At that range, my damage is bad and his ... isn't.

Seems a hookbill can do 150dps out to 15km with navy rockets, and with dual webs he has complete range control.
Starting that particular fight from range ... not a good idea.

On the positive side, I did get a spaceship blown up ;)
