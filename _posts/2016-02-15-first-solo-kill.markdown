I was in Okkamon, again (I am seriously thinking about moving my next stash of ships
to Okkamon, I always find my fights there), when a [Breacher](https://zkillboard.com/kill/52052773/)
jumps into my plex.

I stay with fusion (in retrospect, I should have loaded EMP, but I didn't), overload my repper and guns,
and set course to engage.

At first it does not look like I am going to win, he's slowly eroding my tank while I am not
making any progress.  When I start bleeding into structure, suddenly he explodes.  I guess
his stash of charges ran out and my fusion chewed through his armor and structure pretty quick.

I try to lock his pod, but my safety is on yellow from a recent trip to high sec.
Anyway, I am not sure I want to go the -10 route, I guess I'll leave it on yellow for now.

My first solo kill.
