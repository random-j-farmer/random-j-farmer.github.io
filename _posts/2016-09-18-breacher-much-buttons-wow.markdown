So I went on my first roam with my new corp mates from [Black Shark Cult](https://reddit.com/r/blacksharkcult/).
I am still moving, so the only AB frigatte I had on hand was a breacher.  Lovely ship, but in retrospect a poor
choice.  Lots of buttons to press when flying a breacher.  And boy, am I out of practice.

We have a fun little roam around Caldari FW space.  In Eha, we finally find a fight - an 
[Algos](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56148179/) jumps into the small plex a corpie is baiting in.

Really bad performance on my part.  I forgot to switch ammo - I really should have loaded rage
against a destroyer.  I did launch my drones, but I think I forgot to order them to attack.
I did overload my reppers, but I was much too late activating them.  I only got off 2 cycles.

I think I will switch to something that needs less micromanagement for a bit.
